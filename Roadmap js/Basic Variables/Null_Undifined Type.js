// null and undifined 

/*
Similarities: null and unfinied both mean there is no value

null: null will not popup in the programm for an error or something this only returns when its set by a programmer. null return when there is no value but it exists

undifinded: undifind is the default state of everything if let a and console.log(a) then you get undifined becouse there is nothing in it and its basicly not clear if there is gonna be a defined value or not so if its existing or not 
*/

let a 

console.log(a) //undifined
