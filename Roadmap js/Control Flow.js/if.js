// in JS you use if statments to run some certain code block 

if (condition == true) {
    //run this code
}

//now we maybe want to ececute a diffrent block if its not true

if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
  } else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
  }
  
//Sometimes we may have more than two possible outcomes based on the condition we're testing. For this, we can use "else if" statements. Here's the syntax:

if (condition1) {
    // code to execute if condition1 is true
  } else if (condition2) {
    // code to execute if condition2 is true
  } else {
    // code to execute if all conditions are false
  }
