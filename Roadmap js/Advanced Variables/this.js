its not a block that matters the main question is inside out outside a function

if you have a object that calls the fuinction then the object that calls the function is the "this" the is to roule whats on the left of the function is allways the this

/*you can call any function using bind, but you need to passs a object thats refrenced as this, then you get returned a new function */

talk.bind(me) // then you have a function you can call that would refere to the me

//with params

talk.call(me,param,param2)

//with apply
